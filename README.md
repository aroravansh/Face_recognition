# Face Recognition
Hi this is a project where we learn how to create a basic face recognition program using Python and OpenCV
## Objective of The Project
To recognize the face in the camera and name it. Also, if the face is unknown send a text alert with the image to your mobile via Whatsapp
## Hardware needed
* Laptop with inbuilt camera or a webcam
## Software Required
* Python with OpenCV, numpy, os and  pillow libraries installed 
## 3 Phases
 To create the face recognition program, we need to work on 3 different phases which are:
 1. Face detection and gathering data
 2. Training the recognizer
 3. Recognizing the face
